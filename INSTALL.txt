Installation procedure for CATS
===============================

Prerequesites
-------------

- Apache 2.2.4 ist installed and configured to run with HTTPS. The CAcert roots should
  be trusted. 
- PHP 5.2.4
- MySQL (Version 5.0) is installed and running
- git is installed and has access to github.com
- You have a browser with a valid CAcert client certificate installed
- You may want to set up your own CAcert testsystem like described in https://wiki.cacert.org/Software
  to play around with certificates more freely


Setup
-----

- Get CATS from github into your webserver's document directory (or any subdir):
  git clone git@github.com:CAcertOrg/cats.git

- Connect to your MySQL server with an administrative user and create a database for CATS:
  CREATE DATABASE cats_db;
- Create a user for CATS to access the database:
  CREATE USER cats-user IDENTIFIED BY '<a password>';
- Grant the necessary user rights. These are a bit more than the absolute minimum:
  GRANT DELETE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE ON cats_db.* TO cats_user;
- Change the database to the newly created cats_db:
  USE cats_db;
- Execute the scripts from the database subdirectory to create the database structure.
  First execute create_db.sql, then all update*.sql in numerical order

- Change to cats directory, copy index.php.template to index.php
- Edit index.php, replace the string "FILEPATHTOHERE" with the absolute path of the 
  cats directory. Make sure to finish with a slash.
- Change to the includes subdirectory
- Copy db_connect.inc.template to db_connect.inc
- Edit db_connect.inc 
- You may want to install a sample test by executing sample_test.sql from the database directory

- Make sure that the directive "SSLVerifyClient optional" or "SSLVerifyClient require"
  are active for the CATS web directory, otherwise no client certificate login is requested
  from your browser


Create an administrative user
-----------------------------

- Open your browser and browse to your CATS web directory using https.
- Click "Login" and accept registering with "Yes"
- Connect to your mysql database
- Set the admin flag on all existing users (should be only one):
  UPDATE USER SET admin=1;
